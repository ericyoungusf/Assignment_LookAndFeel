            <li>Content – The website can serve as a single source for anyone who wants to visit Tampa and wants to know about Tampa and its neighbouring Cities. We looked up various top attractions in Tampa. Added links to details of various cities. We also added links to many helpful pages that can guide anyone to get familiar with Tampa.   </li>
            <li>Chart – A link to the chart had been added to show the population of cities around Tampa. </li>
            <li>Responsiveness – The website seems to be loading nicely on desktop computer and mobile device as well. Flip the phone horizontally for better view.</li>
            <li>Usability – The website is pretty basic at this stage and is very easy to navigate through.</li>
            <li>Design – We used a frame(grid areas) that has a header and a footer along with three main body sections. One has informaiton about Tampa. the center body has image slideshow and the third has helpful links. </li>
            <li>Group development – we have attached the log to the assignment submission as a comment.</li>
            <li>Reflection - Reflection has also been added in the assignment submission logs as a comment. We wish we had more time to work on this. We're pretty sure we get better "Look and Feel" with more time.</li>
